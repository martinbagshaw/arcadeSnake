### What more do you need to know?

To Run:
- `git clone https://github.com/mr-bagglesworth/arcadeSnake.git`
- `npm i` to get all 59 million dependencies
- `npm run dev` to run this

To Open:
[go to port 1234](http://localhost:1234/)


### What did I learn?

- how to pass a parent's state down to child components as props
- how to map through an array and render it
- a little bit about asynchronicity in React, and how setState works. A lot more to learn on this one still
- a bit more about common bugs that React developers will encounter. More useful info can be found in this [FreeCodeCamp Article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-work-with-react-the-right-way-to-avoid-some-common-pitfalls-fc9eb5e34d9e)
